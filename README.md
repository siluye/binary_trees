# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

This is a partner project, which I did the project all by myself, in which I learned about the details, advantages, and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. I also learned how to qualify trees as well as how to traverse them. Throughout the project, I implemented binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.

## Tasks :page_with_curl: <br>
* **0. New node**
  * [0-binary_tree_node.c](./0-binary_tree_node.c): C function that inserts a node as the left-child of another.<br>
* **1. Insert left**
  * [1-binary_tree_insert_left.c](./1-binary_tree_insert): C function that inserts a node as the left-child of another.<br>
* **2. Insert right**
  * [2-binary_tree_insert_right.c](./2-binary_tree_insert_right.c): C function that inserts a node as the right-child of another.
* **3. Delete**<br>
  * [3-binary_tree_delete.c](./3-binary_tree_delete.c): C function that deletes an entire binary tree.
* **4. Is leaf**<br>
  * [4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c](./4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c): C function that checks if a given node is a leaf.
* **5. Is root**<br>
  * [5-binary_tree_is_root.c](./5-binary_tree_is_root.c): C function that checks
  if a given node is a root.
* **6. Pre-order traversal**<br>
  * [6-binary_tree_preorder.c](./6-binary_tree_preorder.c): C function that
  traverses a tree using pre-order traversal.
