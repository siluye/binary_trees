# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

This is a partner project, which I did the project all by myself, in which I learned about the details, advantages, and disadvantages of using trees as data structures. I also learned how to qualify trees as well as how to traverse them. Throughout the project, I implemented binary, binary search, AVL, and Max Binary Heap trees.
